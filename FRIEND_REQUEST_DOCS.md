# Friend Request System Documentation

## Overview
The chat application now includes a comprehensive friend request system with detailed user information display and proper accept/ignore functionality.

## Features

### 1. Enhanced Friend Request Notifications
- Friend requests appear in the notifications panel with `[FRIEND REQUEST]` prefix
- Clicking on a friend request notification opens a detailed dialog window
- No more intrusive popup dialogs during chat

### 2. Detailed Friend Request Dialog
When a user clicks on a friend request notification, they see:
- **User Profile Picture**: Shows sender's profile image or default avatar
- **User Information Display**:
  - Username
  - Department
  - Session/Year
- **Two Action Buttons**:
  - **Accept**: Adds the sender as a friend and updates both users' friend lists
  - **Ignore**: Declines the request and notifies the sender

### 3. Server-Side Enhancements
- Friend requests now include complete sender information from `users.json`
- Offline friend requests are stored with full user details
- Proper friendship tracking and JSON file updates

## How It Works

### Sending Friend Requests
1. User opens "Find Friend" window
2. Selects a user from the registered users list
3. Clicks "Send Friend Request"
4. Server forwards the request with sender's complete profile information

### Receiving Friend Requests
1. Friend request appears in notifications panel with `[FRIEND REQUEST]` prefix
2. User clicks on the notification
3. Detailed dialog opens showing:
   - Sender's profile picture
   - Complete user information (name, department, session)
   - Accept/Ignore buttons
4. User decision updates both users' friend JSON files

### File Updates
When a friend request is accepted:
- Both users' `friends_*.json` files are updated
- Server reloads friendship data for proper tracking
- Both users can now send messages and files to each other

## Technical Implementation

### Server Changes (`server.py`)
```python
# Friend requests now include sender details
"sender_info": {
    "name": sender_info.get("name", from_user),
    "dept": sender_info.get("dept", "Unknown"), 
    "session": sender_info.get("session", "Unknown")
}
```

### Client Changes (`client_gui.py`)
- New `show_friend_request_dialog()` method creates detailed UI
- Enhanced `add_home_notification()` stores sender information
- Updated notification click handler for friend requests
- New `remove_notification()` helper method

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   python client_gui.py  # User A
   python client_gui.py  # User B
   ```

2. **Send Friend Request**:
   - Login as User A (e.g., "adib")
   - Click "Find Friend"
   - Select User B from the list
   - Click "Send Friend Request"

3. **Receive and Process Request**:
   - Login as User B (e.g., "omar")
   - See `[FRIEND REQUEST] adib: sent you a friend request` in notifications
   - Click on the notification
   - View detailed dialog with adib's information
   - Click "✓ Accept" (green) or "✗ Ignore" (red) button
   - Both buttons have hover effects and are clearly visible

4. **Verify Friendship**:
   - Both users should see each other in friend lists
   - Both users can now send messages and files
   - Friend JSON files are updated

## Dialog Features

### Enhanced Button Design:
- **Accept Button**: Green with checkmark (✓ Accept)
- **Ignore Button**: Red with X mark (✗ Ignore)
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons darken when mouse hovers over them
- **Large Size**: 14pt font, raised relief, easy to click
- **Professional Styling**: Proper spacing and visual feedback

## Troubleshooting

### If buttons are not clickable:
1. Check the console for debug messages
2. Run `python test_dialog.py` to test basic dialog functionality
3. Make sure the dialog window has focus
4. The buttons should have hover effects (darker color on mouse over)

### Debug Information:
The implementation includes debug print statements:
- "Friend request notification clicked for [username]"
- "Opening friend request dialog for [username]"
- "Accept/Ignore button clicked for [username]"
- Check the console/terminal for these messages

### Button Characteristics:
- **Accept**: Green (#28A745) with ✓ symbol, hovers to darker green
- **Ignore**: Red (#DC3545) with ✗ symbol, hovers to darker red
- **Size**: Large buttons (width=12, height=2) for easy clicking
- **Font**: 14pt bold for clear visibility

## Files Modified
- `server.py`: Enhanced friend request handling with user info
- `client_gui.py`: New dialog system and notification improvements
- Added test files for validation

## Benefits
- **Better User Experience**: Detailed information helps users make informed decisions
- **Professional UI**: Clean dialog with proper styling and layout
- **Robust System**: Proper error handling and file management
- **Security**: Friendship verification before allowing communication
